# Cybathlon-2020-Powered-Exoskeleton-Race
The project with title "Cybathlon 2020 Powered Exoskeleton Race - Closing the sensory and control loop of assistive gait technology for spinal cord injury patients - A center of pressure estimation with vibrotactile feedback case study", aimed at developing an external portable system to improve the control performance of a powered lower limb exoskeleton. This was achieved through development of a foot pressure sensing system providing additional sensor information to exoskeleton motion controller based on plantar pressure measurements, specifically the centre of pressure (CoP) shift of the body, and meaningful and intuitive haptic feedback to the user, based on plantar pressure measurements.
